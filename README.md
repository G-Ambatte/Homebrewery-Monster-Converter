# Homebrewery-Monster-Converter
A quick JS bookmarklet converter to change Homebrewery Monster blocks from Legacy code to V3.

## How to use this project

#### Installation

1. Create a new bookmark in your browser. Chrome is strongly recommended, as it is the only browser Homebrewery officially supports. It is likely that you will get unexpected results with other browsers.

2. Give the bookmark whatever name you like - "HB Monster Converter", for example.

3. Copy the contents of `src/bookmarklet.js` into the URL field.

4. Click "Save".

#### Use

1. Navigate to https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/new.

2. Click the bookmark created during the installation process.

3. Paste the legacy monster block source text into the prompt window that appears. Click OK to start the conversion process.

4. On completion, a window will appear, informing you that the modified text has been copied to the clipboard, and showing the output text.

5. Paste the clipboard content into your Homebrew editor in the desired location.
